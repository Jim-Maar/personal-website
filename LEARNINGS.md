# Learnings
- Here I want to write down everything I learned in this project

## Challenges
- Create a simple HTML file with Css
    - I think this is pretty clear: The Fireship videos give a good intro
    - In CSS you could do some weird stuff, like animations
    - Also more advanced useful stuff like grid layout
    - Hosting with Liver Server works great!
